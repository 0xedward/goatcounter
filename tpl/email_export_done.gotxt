Hi there,

The GoatCounter export youâ€™ve requested is finished, go here to download it:
{{.Site.URL}}/download-export

{{nformat .Rows .Site}} rows have been exported with a file size of {{.Size}}M.

The pagination cursor is {{.LastID}}; you can use this to export only hits that were recorded after this export.

The export will be removed after 24 hours.
