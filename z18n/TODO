Add ability to add context to messages; for example:

    Last
    <button class="link" name="period" value="day">day</button> ·
    <button class="link" name="period" value="week">week</button> ·

"last" isn't very clear, and can be translated in multiple ways.

Maybe just as a comment?

  {{/* z18n: followed by day, week, etc. To go back one period. */}}
  {{t "last|Last"}}

Or maybe just keep it in a separate file instead of inline?

Add support for localizing numbers, dates.

Figure out what to do with stuff like:

	Please verify your email by clicking the link sent to {{.User.Email}}.
	<sup>(<a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/help#verify-email" target="_blank">Why?</a>)</sup><br>

	Change the email address in the <a href="/user">settings</a> –
	<form method="post" action="/user/resend-verify">
		<input type="hidden" name="csrf" value="{{.User.CSRFToken}}">
		<button class="link">Resend email</button>.
	</form>

I'd really like to avoid embeding HTML in translation strings, but we need to
mark what needs wrapped in HTML *somehow*.

We could use the existing [[ .. ]] syntax for this:

	{{t .Context "change-email|Change the email address in the [[settings]]"}}

But we need a way to say what HTML to add:

	{{t .Context "change-email|Change the email address in the [[settings]]" "<a href=\"/user\">" "</a>"}}


	l.T(ctx, "Highlight %(email)", z18n.Em(email))           Wrap in <em> tag
	l.T(ctx, "Link %(email)", z18n.A(email, "/foo/bar"))     Wrap in <a> tag
